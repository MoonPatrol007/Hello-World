# Hello-World
This is my introduction into the GitHub world. Coding here I come...
Hello GitHub world, I finally decided to enter into the Matrix (the Developer world). I have a little bit of coding knowledge, but I want to improve in everyway with the goal to be at the master level to help others. I'm currently learning Java and Python, and I have a little expericnce in MATLAB too. However MATLAB is slowly fading way since I don't use it much. Lastly I hope to gain a lot of knowledge from the GitHub community. So, let the fun begin.
